# Wedding Hooks Begone Mod
**Wedding Hooks Begone** is a mod for [Crusader Kings III](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/) designed to get rid of those favor hooks that happen at weddings.
This is because you would randomly get favor hooks without choice. Especially when, for example your king dies suddenly, and since your heir was controlled by an AI while attending the wedding, they accumuluted loads of favor hooks. Those favor hooks get used by weak and powerful vassals alike, against your new king, since they dislike him. 
The next thing you know, civil war.
